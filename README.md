# Linear Regression on Salary Data 📊💼

This project shows how to use linear regression to predict salary based on years of experience. It’s a simple and beginner-friendly example of how machine learning can find patterns in data and make predictions.

# What’s Inside 📂

- Dataset: A CSV file with two columns – `YearsExperience` and `Salary`.
  
- Notebook: A step-by-step Jupyter Notebook that:
  - Loads and looks at the data 📥
  - Creates a scatter plot to see the trend 📉
  - Builds a linear regression model using scikit-learn 🧠
  - Checks how well the model performs ✅
  - Draws the regression line on the graph ✍️

# Tools Used 🛠️

- Python (Jupyter Notebook) 🐍
- Pandas for handling data 📊
- Matplotlib for plotting 📈
- Scikit-learn for the regression model 🤖

# How to Use 🚀

1. Download or clone the repository.  
2. Open the notebook with Jupyter or any compatible tool.  
3. Run the cells to follow the full analysis. 🎓

This is a great mini-project if you’re new to machine learning and want to learn by doing. 💡
